# Non-Euclidian-World
Graphics Application Programming final project

I would like my final project to use shaders and virtual camera rendering in order to give the sense of a non-euclidian world in Unity. 
This means that I would like to make features such as a smooth transitioning portal (i.e the game portal) or and impossible cube.
